# Checks the app version to upgrade with the existing app version and returns:
# - UPSTREAM_APP if the upstream app version has changed
# - YNH_APP if only the YunoHost app has changed

## It stops the current script without error if the package is up-to-date
#
# This helper should be used to avoid an upgrade of an app, or the upstream part
# of it, when it's not needed
#
# To force an upgrade, even if the package is up to date,
# you have to set the variable YNH_FORCE_UPGRADE before.
# example: sudo YNH_FORCE_UPGRADE=1 yunohost app upgrade MyApp
